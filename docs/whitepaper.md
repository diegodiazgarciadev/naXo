# naXo – (Extreme Modularity in Robotics Through Multi-Agent Systems)

## Abstract
This work introduces **naXo**, a novel approach to robotics that conceptualizes every actionable hardware component—from servomotors to sensors—as independent AI agents collaborating within a multi-agent system. Much like swarms, each unit performs its local function, while global rules guide the collective behavior. Leveraging Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) principles and the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), naXo enables agents and task configuration in natural language, minimizing the need for manual programming, and task orchestration with a variety of possibilities: sequential, parallel, or hierarchical. This approach fosters scalability, adaptability, and modularity in robotic systems. We demonstrate its feasibility through examples such as generating facial expressions in a robotic head or creating Morse code signals. Finally, we discuss future challenges, including automatic hardware detection and metadata standardization, to further enhance the system’s scalability and usability.

## 1. Introduction
Modern robotics faces increasing complexity due to the need for flexible designs, scalability, and adaptability to diverse use cases. Traditional systems rely on extensive manual programming, making the integration of new components both time-intensive and error-prone.

In this context, **naXo** adopts a swarm-like perspective by conceptualizing each hardware component—be it a servomotor, sensor, or other device—as an independent AI agent. These hardware AI agents operate within a multi-agent system: each unit performs its local function, while global rules guide the collective behavior. This enables the system to adapt and self-organize efficiently, reducing the need for exhaustive programming for every possible interaction.

By leveraging multi-agent system architectures that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), naXo allows users to configure tasks using natural language. This paper introduces naXo as a foundational step toward a more accessible and adaptable future for robotics. Our initial use cases—such as creating dynamic facial expressions on a robot using servos and generating Morse code signals—demonstrate the system’s flexibility. Furthermore, we discuss a vision in which hardware components are manufactured with preloaded metadata containing agent-specific information (e.g., via QR codes) to enable near-instant integration and configuration.

Finally, we explore the implications of **naXo** for modularity, scalability, and user accessibility, while outlining key challenges such as automatic hardware detection and real-time communication.

## 2. State of the Art
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in various domains, including logistics, traffic systems, and cooperative robotics. However, their use in robotics tends to focus on collaboration among complete robots or well-defined subsystems, rather than on the autonomy of each individual hardware component.

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and other state-of-the-art models have changed how we interact with computational systems by transforming natural language inputs into programmatic actions. Although LLMs have become widely adopted in areas like virtual assistants and text-generation tools, their potential impact on hardware configuration and robotics is still in its early stages.

**naXo** combines these two trends—Multi-Agent Systems and LLMs—to enable extreme modularity in robotics. Each hardware component functions autonomously within the system, collaborating dynamically to achieve shared goals. While natural language can be used to define high-level inputs or objectives, task orchestration is managed internally by the multi-agent system.

## 3. Central Concept: naXo
The **naXo** project defines each hardware component as an autonomous agent, operating independently while coordinating with others through system-wide rules and tasks. Each agent is structured around several key facets:

- **Technical Definition**  
  Represents the manufacturer-provided specifications of the hardware component, such as its physical or electronic characteristics. For example, a servo might have a full movement range of 0° to 180° or specific power requirements.

- **Functional Definition**  
  Contextualizes the component within the system by defining its specific role and practical limitations. For instance, a servo assigned as the “upper left eyelid” of a robotic head might have its range restricted to 55°–100°, aligning with the functional needs of the application.

- **Role and Goal**  
  Specifies the identity and purpose of the agent within the system. For example, a servo might be assigned the role of **Upper Left Eyelid** with the goal of **Determining the necessary angles and moving to convey the desired expression**.

- **Expected Output**  
  Defines the measurable result that determines task success. In **naXo**, this is explicitly outlined within the task description, ensuring clear criteria for completion. For example, verifying that a servo has moved to the correct angle would indicate successful execution. Additionally, agents incorporate error-handling mechanisms, retrying actions as needed to achieve the expected result. This is particularly valuable in hardware systems, where interactions with the physical world can be unpredictable.

These agents, akin to members of a swarm, act locally but adhere to global rules to ensure consistency across the system. Task orchestration can be performed in various modes—sequentially, in parallel, or hierarchically—depending on the complexity and requirements of the application. In the current implementation, tasks are executed sequentially, ensuring step-by-step validation of results.

While the current system requires manual configuration of agents and tasks, the vision for **naXo** includes simplifying integration. Future hardware components could carry preloaded metadata (e.g., via QR codes) to define their technical and functional parameters, enabling near-instant setup and seamless scalability. This approach would significantly reduce setup time while enhancing adaptability to new hardware and configurations.

### 4. Main Objectives

- **Extreme Modularity**  
  Facilitate the integration and reuse of hardware components across different robotic projects with minimal effort. Each component is treated as an autonomous agent, allowing seamless adaptability to various contexts and applications. While this modularity is already demonstrated in current implementations, further improvements are planned to streamline the configuration process.

- **Scalability**  
  Enable system expansion by adding new components (agents) without requiring major changes to the overall architecture. The current implementation of **naXo** already facilitates the straightforward addition of new components, such as servos, by leveraging its modular design. This ensures the system remains efficient and manageable, even as the number of components grows or the configurations become more complex.

- **Dynamic Collaboration**  
  Promote local decision-making by agents and their ability to respond to the actions of others when necessary. For instance, in a robotic eye, the lower eyelid servo might determine its position by first observing the position of the upper eyelid servo. This inter-agent communication ensures that both components work together cohesively to create the intended expression, aligning with swarm principles to achieve a shared global goal. Although current implementations primarily focus on simpler sequential task execution, the foundation for more complex collaborative behavior is being laid.

- **Simplification of Robotic Design**  
  Reduce the need for specialized programming by leveraging modular configurations and intuitive interfaces. Although the current version of **naXo** requires expertise for setup and execution, the project’s roadmap envisions a system where task setup and execution are significantly simplified, enabling broader accessibility and ease of use.

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1 Agent Definition

In **naXo**, hardware components such as servos, sensors, or motors are treated as specialized agents within the system. Unlike traditional agents in multi-agent systems, hardware agents are characterized by properties specific to their physical nature and interaction with the real world. Each hardware component is defined according to:

- **Technical Specifications:** These include manufacturer-provided details such as torque, rotation range, sensor resolution, or power consumption, which define the physical capabilities of the hardware. These specifications ensure that the system understands the physical limits and behavior of each component.

- **Functional Role:** This describes the specific role and context of the component within the system. For instance, a servo might be defined as the "upper eyelid" of the left eye in a robotic head designed for educational purposes. The robotic head might simulate human expressions to interact with students, requiring the servo to move between 55°–100° to realistically replicate emotions. By defining the functional role, the hardware is positioned within the system, ensuring its purpose aligns with the overall application.

- **Limitations:** These are constraints imposed by the system or design, such as restricted movement ranges, power availability, or dependencies on other components. For example, the servo’s effective range in the robotic head may be limited to ensure realistic motion, even if its technical specification allows a broader movement.

This detailed definition of hardware agents allows **naXo** to effectively manage their integration and functionality within the system. By explicitly separating technical specifications, functional roles, and limitations, the system bridges the gap between theoretical design and practical application, making it highly adaptable.

Future iterations of **naXo** aim to simplify this process further by embedding metadata or QR codes directly into hardware components. These enhancements would allow the system to automatically detect and configure the hardware agent, enabling near-instant integration and significantly reducing setup time.

### 5.2 Multi-Agent Framework

The **naXo** framework is built around the following key components:
- **Agents:** Autonomous entities representing hardware components (e.g., servos, sensors). Each agent is responsible for executing specific tasks based on its role and capabilities.  
- **Tasks:** Actions assigned to agents that define the operations to be performed. Tasks are explicitly defined and include expected outputs, ensuring clarity and error handling.  
- **Tools:** Functionalities or interfaces that agents use to execute tasks. For example, REST-based commands for controlling servos.

Task orchestration in **naXo** can be defined in different ways, providing flexibility for various applications:
- The current implementation uses a **sequential model**, where tasks are executed one after another. Communication between tasks occurs within this sequence to ensure synchronization.  
- Future iterations of **naXo** could leverage available task orchestration models, such as hierarchical or parallel, to address more complex workflows and enhance system efficiency, depending on application needs.

### 5.3 Simplified Infrastructure

The underlying infrastructure of **naXo** focuses on simplicity and abstraction to manage hardware components effectively:
- **Low-Level Abstraction:** A microcontroller manages mechanical details, such as servo movement, freeing the system from handling these complexities directly.
- **Simple Interfaces:** REST requests serve as the interface between the central system and hardware-managing agents, making communication straightforward and efficient.

### 5.4 Use of LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) are an inherent part of the AI agents in **naXo**, serving as the reasoning engine for decision-making and task execution. This integration distinguishes **naXo** from traditional multi-agent systems, as each hardware agent not only performs predefined actions but also interprets its goals and roles through the reasoning capabilities of an LLM. Current applications of LLMs in **naXo** include:

- **Agent Definition:** LLMs define the goals, roles, and functional descriptions of agents, ensuring precise characterization and integration of hardware components.  
- **Tool Descriptions:** LLMs assist in creating detailed descriptions of tools, mapping tasks accurately to the actions required for hardware operation.  
- **Task Actions:** Tasks are described and structured using natural language, enabling dynamic and adaptive execution based on the agent's predefined goals.  

In **naXo**, the multi-agent system leverages LLMs to enhance collaboration and adaptability. This approach allows tasks to be defined with greater flexibility and facilitates dynamic decision-making by agents. While LLMs are already a core part of **naXo**, future iterations aim to expand their role further by streamlining task orchestration and enabling real-time updates to agent configurations.

## 8. Challenges and Future Research

1. **Automatic Hardware Detection and Task Orchestration:**  
   Developing mechanisms for automatic recognition and configuration of new hardware components will streamline the integration process. Once detected, the system should automatically assign and orchestrate tasks associated with these new agents, reducing the need for manual setup.

2. **Hardware Standardization for Agents:**  
   Proposing standardized formats for embedding metadata, such as QR codes, directly into hardware components would enable seamless recognition and self-integration. This standardization should also support automatic task generation and alignment with the system’s global goals, enhancing interoperability and scalability.

3. **LLM Optimization:**  
   Reducing latency and resource consumption in real-time scenarios is crucial for scaling **naXo**. Exploring lightweight language models or task-specific optimizations could enhance system performance without sacrificing adaptability.

4. **Integration with Larger-Scale Robotics:**  
   Extending the methodology to more complex systems, such as robotic arms, drones, or industrial vehicles, would test the scalability and versatility of **naXo** in diverse applications.

5. **Real-Time Communication:**  
   While **naXo** focuses on the behavior and orchestration of agents, the physical connection and communication between hardware components and agents are not currently addressed in this project. Future work should explore robust communication protocols, such as ROS or CAN, to enable precise synchronization in scenarios that demand high coordination and low latency. Addressing this gap would significantly enhance the system’s applicability to real-world, large-scale deployments.
