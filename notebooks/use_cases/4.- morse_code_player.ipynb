    "In this cell, we define the `ServoControlTool`, a custom tool designed to control servo motors using REST services hosted on an ESP32 device. Here's what the tool can do:\n",
    "- **Move individual servos**: Specify the servo and the target angle, ensuring it's within the allowed range.\n",
    "- **Perform predefined actions**: Execute actions like \"blink\" or \"double blink\".\n",
    "- **Execute complex sequences**: Handle lists of commands, including servo movements, actions, and pauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool includes:\n",
    "1. **Validation of servo names and angles**: Ensures commands won't cause errors or unsafe movements.\n",
    "2. **Error handling**: Manages network issues and invalid inputs gracefully.\n",
    "3. **Support for synchronous and asynchronous execution**: Adapts to various use cases.\n",

    "### Defining the Crew for Morse Code Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cell, we define the `Crew`, which acts as the orchestrator for the system. The crew **coordinates the agents and their assigned tasks**, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Crew Structure**\n",
    "1. **Agents**:  \n",
    "   - The crew includes the **Morse Agent (`morse_agent`)**, responsible for converting text into Morse code and then into servo blinking sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tasks**:  \n",
    "   - The **Morse Task (`morse_task`)** handles the **full transformation pipeline**, from text input to servo commands:\n",
    "     1. **Convert text to Morse code** (`textToMorseTool`).\n",
    "     2. **Map Morse symbols to servo movements** (`morseToBlinkTool`).\n",
    "     3. **Execute the blinking sequence** (`servoControlTool`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Additional parameters**:\n",
    "   - **`verbose=True`**: Enables detailed logs during execution, making it easier to debug or observe agent interactions.\n",
    "   - **`memory=False`**: Ensures that the system does not retain previous states, processing each input independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why This Approach?**\n",
    "- This **modular architecture** allows new agents or tasks to be added effortlessly.\n",
    "- The **crew handles coordination**, letting individual tools focus on their specific tasks.\n",
    "- The setup makes it possible to extend functionality beyond blinking—potentially integrating new communication methods, audio signals, or physical gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation showcases the power of **naXo's scalable, multi-agent approach**, demonstrating how **hardware can dynamically adapt to new tasks with minimal reconfiguration**.\n"
