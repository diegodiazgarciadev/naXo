    "# Defining the Servo Control Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cell, we define the `ServoControlTool`, a custom tool designed to control servo motors using REST services hosted on an ESP32 device. Here's what the tool can do:\n",
    "- **Move individual servos**: Specify the servo and the target angle, ensuring it's within the allowed range.\n",
    "- **Perform predefined actions**: Execute actions like \"blink\" or \"double blink\".\n",
    "- **Execute complex sequences**: Handle lists of commands, including servo movements, actions, and pauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool includes:\n",
    "1. **Validation of servo names and angles**: Ensures commands won't cause errors or unsafe movements.\n",
    "2. **Error handling**: Manages network issues and invalid inputs gracefully.\n",
    "3. **Support for synchronous and asynchronous execution**: Adapts to various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The servo ranges are predefined, and the tool interacts with the ESP32 via HTTP requests.\n"
